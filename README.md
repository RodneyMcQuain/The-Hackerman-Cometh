# The Hackerman Cometh
The Hackerman Cometh teaches security vulnerabilities through the use of interactive tutorials.  The goal of this project is to assist another generation to white hat hack and thus, lead to another generation of ethical hackers. Additionally, we aim to teach web developers about security so that they don’t write insecure code that leads to harming their product and or users.
